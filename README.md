This repository contains the implementation of our drone-based framework for **localizing surfaced marine robots using aerial GNSS-equipped drones and vision-based estimation**. This scalable and cost-efficient method supports both single and multi-robot tracking using YOLOv11 and geometric inference.

## üåä Abstract
Accurate localization is crucial for underwater robotics, yet traditional onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) approaches are difficult or ineffective due to signal reflection on the water‚Äôs surface. Existing approaches, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM and acoustic-based methods, face challenges like error accumulation and high computational complexity. Therefore, a more efficient and scalable solution remains necessary. This paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages an aerial drone equipped with GNSS localization to track and localize an underwater robot near the surface. Our results show that this novel adaptation enables accurate single and multi-robot underwater localization.  

## üöÄ Overview

Traditional underwater localization methods suffer from signal loss, sensor drift, or infrastructure cost. We propose an aerial solution using:

- A GNSS-enabled drone
- Vision-based detection (YOLOv11)
- Geometric estimation

This project demonstrates real-time, accurate GNSS localization of marine robots (e.g., Aqua2) during surfacing events.
